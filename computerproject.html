<li> Recently Worn Socks (Key Words:<i><u> Recently Worn </i></u>)
<li> Clocks
<li> High BPM Songs

<br>
<h3><u> <font color="red"> Recommended </font> Actions (Ranked by Order) </u></h3>
<ol>
<li>Don't Even Think of Them. Well, Since You Read the Document, This Action is Out of Option. They're Going to Come For You Tonight. There's Always Anesthesia Though. Self-Administration is Strongly Recommended.
<li>Keep a Distance Between Them. Carry Garlic. They May Not Be a Vampire But Nobody Likes Uncooked Garlic. 
<li>While Raising Your AK-47, yell, "IF YOU WANT ME TO KISS YOUR ASS, BEAT THIS". Do NOT Pull The Trigger. You Can Create An Illusion of An Attempt. But Whatever You Do, DO/NOT PULL THE TRIGGER. DO PULL THE TRIGGER 
<li>if You Are Near Them, Close Your Eyes and Spin in Circles. While Spinning, Sing "Livin On A Prayer" (Because You Are). 
<li>Jokingly Offer Yourself As A Sacrafice to Them. The Key Word is <i><u> Jokingly </i></u>. You Must Get The Intent and Inntonation Correct. (This Option May Be Inacessible to Many Neurodivergent People).

<h3><u> <font color="red"> UNRecommended </font> Actions (Ranked by Order) </u></h3>
<ol>
<li> Offer UnWorn Socks. It Doesn't Matter If You Wore it More Than 20 Years Ago. That Period Is Older Than This Entity. It's Also Older Than the "Recently Worn" Period.
<li> Offer Yourself As A Sacrfiice Without The Intention or Inntonation of A Jokester. Most of the Entity's Victims Are Neurodivergent. (Did This Author Forget that This Entity Said, "I Thought Neurotypical People Could't Get Any More Boring, But Then Their Meat Tastes Blander Than British?") 
<li> Use Customary Units While Thinking of Them. It Doesn't Matter if You Only Think of Them For a Second. You Will Die Within Minutes to Hours. (That's The One Thing The Author Got Right. How Do I Know? I'm Playing With Their Dead Body). 
<li> Don't Offer Recently Unworn Socks.
<li> You Have No Hope of Survival. 
</ol> 
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h3><u> <font color="red"> What To Do </font> If Caught </u></h3>
<ul>
<li>Pray to God As the Entity is Approaching You. You're Probably Dead Meat But At Least You Won't Die Hopeless.
<li>If You Are Lucky, Sacrifice a Person Named "Prof. Hom". Don't Worry If His Family Sues You. Eventually, That Guy Was Going to Meet God Anyways. (Also He Resurrects Himself Every Five Years So...) <- Dubious Information. That Guy Was Going to Meet the Aliens Anyways.
